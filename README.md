# AGS.Plugin.PluginManager
A plugin for managing editor plugins

This plugin is in develpoment.

It is delivered with a file (which contains a link to a repository).
e.g. an official repository and one with own plugins.
The intention is to synced all the repos.

The repos contains a list with download links and versions to several plugins.

A plugin can included in the repo with a PR.
If someone abandones his repo, it can be set to `blocked`by the other repos and therefore it is only read when blocking-repo-read-is-allowed.
